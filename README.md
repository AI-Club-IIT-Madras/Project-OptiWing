# Project-OptiWing

Airfoil optimization plays a big part in determining the aerodynamic characteristics of many things, such as F1 cars, aircrafts, and rockets.

The project aims to leverage the learning capabilities of Deep Learning for the inverse-design of airfoils, by using simulation software to generate pressure distribution data for different values of angle of attack and Reynoldâ€™s number. Future applications involve turbomachinery and other 3D modeling applications.
